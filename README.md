# HKI Freescout Component
This component was created for a specific purpose, but I figured I'd share it with anyone that wants it. You can use this component to connect Freescout (Ticketing System) to Home Assistant.
It will create a set of sensors (like how many new tickets are created or unanswered tickets) and automate based of that. You might want to notify one when too many tickets are unanswered or if you simply want to trigger a notification on each new ticket.

*Documentation is currently missing!
